# RayTracer
Ray tracer library built using the Ray Tracer Challenge book written by Jamis Buck.

Additionally, in progress, a framework agnostic UI library and WPF desktop application for creating scenes with the RayTracer library. Possible future implementations in other UI frameworks such as Avalonia UI and/or MAUI.NET.
